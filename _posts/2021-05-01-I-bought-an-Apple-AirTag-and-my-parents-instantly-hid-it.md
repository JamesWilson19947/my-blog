</div>I bought the newest [Apple Airtag](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-airtag/airtag), I've always wanted the Tile which is sort of similar, but I decided to go for the Apple Airtag because I am deep inside the Apple ecosphere at this stage. The AirTag has some impressive features, seeing its only Â£30.

It uses bluetooth to communicate with the iPhone, allowing you to track it, including precision tracking, and the ability if the AirTag is lost to put it into a "lost" mode, and this will let other people with iPhones detect it, and alert you. Neat.

Ironically whilst the AirTag was being delivered, they actually lost the AirTag. Luckily it was quickly resolved by DHL and Apple, and I managed to get my hands on the Airtag.

I'm fourtunate or unfourtunate enough to still live with my parents, (depending how you look at it) and as soon as I paired the AirTag to my iPhone, my parents thought it would be a great idea to hide it!

They hid it well as-well, but i was somewhat impressed with how well I managed to find it, using the precision tracking and the audible noise it makes, I was able to locate it, much to my parents disatisfaction as they instanly decided to hide again, but somewhere much harder to find.

But it was no problem, as with precision tracking I was actually able to find it.

I no longer have to worry about my keys getting lost or stolen (well mostly), because I have confidence in the AirTag and the ability to find it should it go "missing"!
