Its always hard making the decision of if a purchase is worth it. Especially when it averages around Â£700-800 in the UK. The P950 is a bridge camera from Nikon, and as a photographer the idea of a bridge camera made me feel weird.

The Nikon P950's amazing feature is that it can zoom, up to 96x I believe, which is crazy when you think to do that with a normal lens your talking thousands of pounds.

But of course like with anything, it has its down sides. Because its a bridge camera with a gigantic zoom it has a tiny teeny sensor, in-fact the sensor is around the same size as you have in a phone, which is pretty small.


This means in low light situations the P950 does not do well at all, but then if you have bought this camera expecting it to do well in low light situations, its probably not the camera for you.


This camera has one great feature and thats the zoooooooom.

## The Zooooooooom

So probably the best thing about this camera is the ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.

This is a jet which is 30,000ft, I couldn't see it was a Boeing 747 by just looking but this zoom allows me to see it, of course the problem you get is heat blur which you can see here, which is why the plane isn't super sharp. 

Overall this camera is great, and I hope to use it more. Check out my photos for more images.
